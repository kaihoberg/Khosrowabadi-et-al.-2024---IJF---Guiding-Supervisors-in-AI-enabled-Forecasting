This folder contains data, analysis code, and experiment code for the paper "Guiding Supervisors in AI-enabled Forecasting:
Understanding the Impact of Salience and Detail on Decision-Making" By Naghmeh Khosrowabadi, Kai Hoberg*, and Yun-Shin Lee submitted to the International Journal of Forecasting ISF, which is conditionally accepted. 

If you have any question, please feel free to contact the corresponding author, Professor Kai Hoberg at KLU in Hamburg, Germany: kai.hoberg@klu.org

Here is the list of packages we used in R version 3.6.0.
readr 1.3.1
dplyer 0.8.1

Here is the list of system libraries:
base 3.6.0
datasets 3.6.0
graphics 3.6.0
grDevices 3.6.0
methods 3.6.0
stats 3.6.0
utils 3.6.0

We included the table numbers before the relevant R code, such that you can reproduce the result. 
Figures are mostly screenshots from OTree experiment (Chen et al., 2016), under otree_experiment_code folder, with specifications as follows:
otree>=5.0.0a21, 
psycopg2>=2.8.4, 
coded with PyCharm, 
python 3.9.6.

We hope our research will greatly contribute to the field of AI forecasting and provide practical insights for forecasting system providers and designers.
